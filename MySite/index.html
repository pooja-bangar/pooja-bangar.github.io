		<p>...And I am an aspiring Web Designer, who loves to be part of a team working together to build something exceptional. I have a background in Customer Service and have always been passionate about understanding and exceeding customer expectations.  My most recent professional experience was at a London-based Startup, where I learnt the value of tenacity, ownership and daring to be different. It also introduced me to the wonderful world of Web Design, and I'm really excited about drawing on my Customer Service experience to build intuitive and responsive User Interfaces.</p>
