					<h2>Brief</h2>
					<p>As part of the Startup Institute Program I had the opportunity to work with Brandnew, a startup that connects brands with influential users to deliver campaigns on Instagram and Pinterest. <a href="https://github.com/AlanVenegas">Alan Venegas</a> and I were given the task of conceptualising and building a Sales Dashboard that would display KPI's per sales person in the company. My focus was to design and build the Front End of the Dashboard. The project was completed in 60 hours, spread over a 5 week period.<p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>Our first step was to really get to know our users, and determine their requirements. We did this by speaking with key team members at Brandnew and learning about systems already in place. I also investigated Front End frameworks that would support the project objectives.</p>
					<h3>Client Needs</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Goal - Drive Sales and increase healthy competition</li>
						<li>How - A ranking of Sales People based on set criteria</li>
						<li>When - Monthly, Yearly, and Quarterly Data</li>
						<li>Where - Displayed on big screen in the main office</li>
					</ul>	
					<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>A series of bar and donut graphs that display data</li>
							<li>A hierarchical sizing structure of charts, based on importance of criteria</li>
							<li>A name index that identifies each person by colour, which is used to display the persons ranking in each chart</li>
							<li>Three screens that regularly toggle between monthly, quarterly and yearly time periods</li>
						</ul>
					<h3>Frameworks</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Morris.js</li>
							<li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
							<li>GitHub</li>
						</ul>	
					<br>	
					<p>I used this research to create a series of mockups using Balsamiq, which were presented and approved by Brandnew. Due to the short timeframe of the project, we dived straight into building the first iteration of our MVP and presented to Brandnew for usability testing. The feedback highlighted important criteria that needed to be added to the dashboard. It also allowed us to refine the hierarchy of the information so that everything displayed was relevant. We then created our final iteration based on the feedback. The objective of the design was to make it easy for the user to identify each Sales Person and subsequently recognise patterns and correlations between each graph.</p> 	
					<h2>Further Iterations</h2>
					<p>Based on the final evaluation from Brandnew the next stage of the project would be to create a desktop version of the dashboard incorporating the following features:</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>A user login</li>
						<li>Date picker functionality that would allow the user to select their own timeframes</li>
						<li>Functionality that would allow the user to only look at data for a selected Sales Person</li>
					</ul>
