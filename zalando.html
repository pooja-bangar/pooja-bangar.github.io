				<h2>Brief</h2>
				<p>Being Europe's largest dedicated online fashion retailer, Zalando really focuses on building a great relationship with their end customer. With a passion for fashion e-commerce and the determination to develop my UX Design skills, I set myself the challenge of exploring ways to support this relationship through the Zalando app.<p>	
				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>My journey began by researching Key Trends in Fashion e-commerce and consumer behaviour, and comparing this to what is already in place on the app.</p>
				<h3>Key Trends</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Personalisation - allowing consumers to interact with brands on their terms</li>
					<li>Community - leveraging Social Media to assist consumers in seeking validation to make a purchase</li>
					<li>Mobile first - creating a minimal but beautiful experience focusing on ease of use and navigation</li>
				</ul>	
				<h3>Already in place</h3>
				<ul>
						<li>Photo search - allowing customers to upload a photo and find similar products</li>
						<li>Last seen - allowing customers to go straight to products viewed during last login</li>
						<li>Sharing - giving customers the option to share items via message, email, and social media</li>
					</ul>	
				<br>
				<p>My next step was to speak to real users of Fashion Mobile Commerce, as well as explore my own needs as customer, and use this information to identify key pain points and possible solutions.</p>
				<h3>Key Pain Points</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Content that isn't relevant to what the user is looking for</li>
					<li>Not having enough control of what items are being recommended</li>
					<li>Going to other sources to validate purchases</li>
					<li>Insufficient product information</li>
				</ul>	
				<h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A detailed profile that allows users to input their likes and what they're looking for</li>
					<li>An event calendar that allows users to enter events and what they need to purchase for that event</li> 
					<li>Functionality that allows users to find friends and create groups that they can share items within</li> 
					<li>Content that is tailored to each customer based on the above features</li>
					<li>Allowing users to ask questions about items</li>
				</ul>	
				</div>
			</div>
				<br>
				<p>I decided to structure my insights by creating a mind map of how different areas of the app would be clustered and identifying key features for each section. I sketched out the navigation and flow on Post-it notes and uploaded the sketches to Marvel to make an interactive prototype with which I conducted usability testing.</p>
				<h2>Usability Testing Feedback </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Uniform interactions - user naturally gravitated towards clicking on text rather than arrows to make a selection</li>
					<li>Always having option to see wishlist and bag when shopping</li>
					<li>Ability to change view of search results, as some items require a more detailed picture than others</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>Based on the feedback, I created my second prototype using Balsamiq wireframes that were also imported into Marvel. My final design aims to provide a very personalised experience, with relevant recommendations that facilitate a higher conversion rate.</p>
				<h2>Further Iterations</h2>
				<p>This is a work in progress so currently I am working on improving the links between each screen, and making it easier for the customer to browse from the home page.</p>
